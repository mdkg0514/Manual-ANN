# Bounding Box Object Detection using CNN

## Overview
This project implements an **Object Detector with Bounding Boxes** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The model is trained to detect objects and predict their bounding box coordinates.

## Features
- Uses a **CNN architecture** to detect objects
- Outputs **bounding box coordinates** for detected objects
- Trained on a dataset with labeled bounding boxes
- Uses **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning implementation

## Installation
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Bounding_Box.ipynb
```

## Files
- `Bounding_Box.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the CNN model for object detection.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with data augmentation
- Implement YOLO-based detection
- Extend to multi-object detection
