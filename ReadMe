# Manual Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## Overview
This project implements a **manual Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** without using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. The goal is to understand the fundamental workings of neural networks by building one from scratch.

## Features
- Implements **forward and backward propagation** manually
- Uses **NumPy** for mathematical computations
- Supports multiple layers and activation functions
- Trains on a small dataset to demonstrate learning

## Installation
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Manual_ANN.ipynb
```

## Files
- `Manual_ANN.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing the manual ANN implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for different optimization techniques
- Implement batch normalization
- Extend to deeper networks
